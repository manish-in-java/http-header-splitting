# Introduction
[HTTP Header Splitting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting) refers to a potential vulnerability
that can exist in web applications.  It is not a threat in itself but opens a web application up to other threats
such as Cross Site Scripting, Cache Poisoning, etc.

This sample application attempts to check popular Java web containers for susceptibility to HTTP Header Splitting.
